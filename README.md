# Data-Challenge-Text-Mining-Green-Way-Challenge
Online News Popularity- Optimization and Text Mining with Sustainability Aspects
In this challenge, we will analyze news articles to determine which features influence their online popularity. We will combine classical optimization methods with text mining techniques while ensuring sustainable data processing by using resource-efficient methods.

Our approach are as follows:
1. Data Preparation:
•	Analyze the dataset.
•	Extract features from the existing texts and URL links (e.g., web scraping).
2. Feature Engineering: 
•	Extract text-based features such as sentiment, polarity, and subjectivity.
•	Identify additional relevant features that could influence shares.
3. Modeling:
•	Perform classical clustering based on extracted features.
•	Build a model to predict the number of shares.
•	Evaluate the importance of different features.
Sustainability:
•	Discuss the impact of resource-efficient methods (e.g., using pre-trained models vs. simpler machine learning techniques).
Minimal Viable Product (MVP):
•	Predict the number of shares on the provided test data.
